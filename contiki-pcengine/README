This is the PCEngine port of Contiki, maintained by Groepaz/Hitmen
<groepaz@gmx.net>.

compiler: cc65, www.cc65.org

PCE specific stuff is enclosed into #ifdef __PCENGINE__

NEC PC-Engine (PCE): [using cc65]
- conio library functions work
- contiki crashes :(
TODO: further development on cc65 libraries...might be a problem with
the 65C02 code generator also
WANTED: someone who owns a PCE and also some kind of development hardware,
so he can try out contiki on the real thing.

have fun, groepaz/hitmen (groepaz@gmx.net)
