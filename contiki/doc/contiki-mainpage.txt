\mainpage The Contiki Operating System

\author Adam Dunkels <adam@dunkels.com>

The Contiki operating system is a highly portable, minimalistic
operating system for a variety of constrained systems ranging from
modern 8-bit microcontrollers for embedded systems to old 8-bit
homecomputers. Contiki provides a simple event driven kernel with
optional preemptive multithreading, interprocess communication using
message passing signals, a dynamic process structure and support for
loading and unloading programs, native TCP/IP support using the uIP
TCP/IP stack, and a graphical subsystem with either direct graphic
support for directly connected terminals or networked virtual display
with VNC or Telnet.

Contiki is written in the C programming language and is freely
available as open source under a BSD-style license. More information
about Contiki can be found at the Contiki home page:
