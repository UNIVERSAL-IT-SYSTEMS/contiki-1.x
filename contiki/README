This is the source code for the Contiki desktop environment, which is
a modern Internet-enabled desktop environment for the Commodore 64 and
a bunch of other systems written by Adam Dunkels. The Contiki desktop
environment includes a simple window system and GUI, TCP/IP
networking, a web server, a telnet client, and a web browser. Contiki
is written in C and is compiled with Ullrich von Bassewitz' cc65 C
compiler.

More information about the Contiki desktop environment can be found on
its web page:

The cc65 C compiler can be found on the cc65 web page:

The Contiki desktop environment source code is divided into the
following directories:

  apps/ - the Contiki applications
  ctk/  - the ctk conio windowing toolkit on which Contiki builds
  ek/   - the ek event kernel and the dispatcher
  lib/  - various library files
  uip/  - the uIP TCP/IP stack

To build the Contiki desktop environment from sources, GNU make and
cc65 must be installed.
