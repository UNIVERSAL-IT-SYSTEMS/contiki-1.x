This is the source code for the Contiki operating system, which is an
open source, highly portable, networked, multi-tasking operating
system for memory-constrained systems, written by Adam
Dunkels. Contiki runs on a variety of tiny systems ranging from
embedded 8-bit microcontrollers to old homecomputers such the
Commodore 64. Code footprint is on the order of kilobytes and memory
usage can be configured to be as low as tens of bytes.

In addition to the source code in this directory, an Contiki port must
be downloaded.

More information about the Contiki desktop environment can be found on
its web page:

The Contiki desktop environment source code is divided into the
following directories:

  apps/ - the Contiki applications
  ctk/  - the Contiki GUI tool kit CTK
  doc/  - documentation
  ek/   - the event-driven kernel
  lib/  - various library files
  uip/  - the uIP TCP/IP stack
